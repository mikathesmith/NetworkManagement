Notes:

- Roaming: move between the presence of multiple access points and still stay connected. 
- Directional links: for hooking up branches of network that are not in the same building 
  (could use VPN)
- Wireless difficult to troubleshoot when dealing with reception and interference issues
  and have security risks - steal internet bandwidth, trace (possible illegal) activity to
  your IP address, break into computers inside the network for stealing data, viruses. 
- WEP -> WPA2 
- Most things that absorb radio frequencies are walls and metal furnitue
- Interference Robustness enabling = tells the device not to use the 1Mbps bit rate
- RTS/CTS for the hidden node problem - N1 and N2 can see AP1 but can’t see each other. N1 
  sends a short RTS, only sends data when AP1 sends CTS. Use an RTS/CTS threshold for 
  packets of a certain size. 
- Configuring Access points: embedded web-server. telnet or SNMP ->Reset to a factory default 
- Access points have an IP address for management purposes: hostname, address, subnet mask, gateway and DNS details. Every AP has the capability to act as a bridge, or to share
one address between everything behind a NAT. They also offer simple DHCP services for 
distributing addresses to clients or to get an address for themselves. Can also act as broadband routers. 
- ESSID/SSID - name of wireless network. 
- Access points offer a feature called a closed network, where the ESSID is not advertised, though anyone with a wireless packet sniffer can easily detect it. 
- Channels - 802.11b/g devices use three contiguous channels (selecting channel 4 also 
  selects 5 and 6). Use channels that don’t interfere to reduce bandwidth. 
- Client/Supplicant supplies information to Access Point/Authenticator, which talks to the 
  authentication service/RADIUS server. 
- SNMP trap alert messages can be sent if someone tries to logon to an AP unsuccessfully
- Syslog server: log events such as attempts and errors

2. Imagine you are setting up a wireless network for a client. How might you evaluate the reliability of your network? You should think about the factors that impact the performance of the network in comparison of wired networks.
- Speed test for internet bandwidth
- Ensure minimal interference (avoid walls and metal furniture) 

3. Add notes for 802.11ac to Table 5.1
- IEEE 802.11 Standards = LAN based protocols. 
   -802.11b: 11Mbps
   -802.11a: higher frequency, less interference with other consumer devices, better 
    performance. Shorter wavelength affected by obstacles, uses more battery power when
    transmitting. Need different antennas. 
   -802.11g: 2.4GHz, susceptible to interference. 11g access points can slow the network 
    down to 11Mbps when an 11b client is present. Can make exclusive 11g client networks 
   -802.11n: enabling technology for wireless multimedia, e.g. HD video. Can use both the 
    2.4GHz and 5GHz frequency bands, or configured to not use one particular band. Twice
    as many channels are used = Channel Bonding. 3 antennas for MIMO, taking advantage of 
    spatial multiplexing to send to two different games at the same  time and doubling the 
    throughput. Better performance indoors due to multi-path interference.  
   
   -802.11ac: providing high throughput WLANS on the 5 GHz band, 256-QAM modulation 
    squeezing 256 different signals over the same frequency. 

4. Suggest a location for a single access point to satisfy the needs of the site survey
- Ground floor lounge as it has a reasonably clear pathway to the rooms upstairs through
  the staircase, which all first floor rooms surround. 


6. Explain the relationship between WEP, WPA, WPA2, and 802.11i.

- WEP (Wired equivalent privacy) is a poor security protocol that uses a pre-shared key 
  to control access and encrypt the packets in the air. Updating key takes a long time, 
  does not change keys periodically, easily break key with enough packets. 
- WPA (Wifi protected access) - an improvement on WEP, still uses RC4 but changes the keys
  periodically using TKIP (temporal key integrity protocol). Key timeout set on AP is 
  default 60 mins (should be 15mins). Two authentication architectures: pre shared key 
  variety called WPA-personal, and a centralized authentication called WPA-Enterprise.  
	-WPA-personal: WPA-PSK, passphrase handled uniformly. Attackers would have to 
         factorise a large number to find the WPA passphrase. 
	-WPA-enterprise: uses 802.1X and RADIUS to authenticate users. Reduce timeout. 
- WPA2 is similar to WPA except it implements the full 802.11i standard. Higher level of 
  protection as it uses AES. 
- WPA is a subset of the 802.11i standard - fairly compatible with most existing hardware and drivers. 


6b. Explain the relationship between RADIUS, 802.1X, EAP and EAP-TTLS.
- EAP (Extensible authentication protocol) comes from dial-up networking. EAP can be used
  for other network authentication tasks. 
- EAP-TTLS (tunneled TLS) is a module that EAP uses as an authentication mechanism in 
  wireless security. It uses an outer and inner authentication protocol. Digital certificates? 
- RADIUS (remote authentication dial-in user service) is used between the AP and the authentication service, that knows about the users and authentication mechanisms
- 802.1X - adapted from EAP, used between the supplicant and authenticator



7. WiFi Protected setup - makes it easier to setup a secure wireless connection. How does it work? Describe PIN and PBC methods. 
- (Belkin) Wifi Protected setup (WPS) is the industry standard to simplify the security
  setup and management of WIFI networks. You can easily connect to a 802.11 network with 
  WPS-certified devices using a personal information number (PIN) or push button 
  configuration (PBC) method. 
- PIN: used to make sure the intended device is added to the network, and no others.  
- PBC: connect multiple devices and enable data encryption by pushing a physical button on
       the router. Be aware that other devices could connect in the 2 minutes.
