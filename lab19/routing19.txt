Broadcast Domains
    Everywhere a data-link level ethernet broadcast frame would propogate to
    This area is demarcated by routers, which signal the end of a layer-2
    (data-link layer) network, to go further requires support at a higher
    layer, such as layer-3 (eg IP) to route the packets through the
    inter-network. 

Collision Domain
    What you have in a mixed ethernet segment, such as on a repeating hub. On a
    switching hub, the collision domain is simply the basic link between the
    host and the switch, typically a single cable, because the basic link is
    not shared between hosts, there are no other stations to contend for access
    to the physical medium. 

VLANS
    The ability to segregate a switch into seperate broadcast-domains. Tio get
    between the different VLANS, a router must be used. 
    Layer-3 switch: a high-speed router embedded as part of the switch 
    VLANs identified by a 12-bit number.
