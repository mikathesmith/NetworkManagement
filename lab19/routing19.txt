Internal Routing
-Vyatta is our routing engine. 
-Virtual LANS - implement network topology. 
-Investigating static routing and the use of the RIP routing protocol 

Vyatta Router - open source virtual router - OpenVN, Quaga
    Command line interface
    $ Operational mode - default after login -> nonconfig commands
    # Config mode - access with configuration -> configure, routing protcool, 
    interface and firewalll settings, VPN settings 
    show configuration
    Supports truncated commands 
    Help menu - ? at end of command
    Configuring host name - first vyatta is username @ vyatta is host name
    set system host-name router
    cannot exit config mode as uncommited change, type commit (in running configuration)
    then need to save. (so it sticks after rebooting) type save
    Need to exit and logout then log back in to see new prompt 
    set system login user student authentication plaintext-password pw 
    
Broadcast Domains
    Everywhere a data-link level ethernet broadcast frame would propogate to
    This area is demarcated by routers, which signal the end of a layer-2
    (data-link layer) network, to go further requires support at a higher
    layer, such as layer-3 (eg IP) to route the packets through the
    inter-network. 

Collision Domain
    What you have in a mixed ethernet segment, such as on a repeating hub. On a
    switching hub, the collision domain is simply the basic link between the
    host and the switch, typically a single cable, because the basic link is
    not shared between hosts, there are no other stations to contend for access
    to the physical medium. 

VLANS
    The ability to segregate a switch into seperate broadcast-domains. Tio get
    between the different VLANS, a router must be used. 
    Layer-3 switch: a high-speed router embedded as part of the switch 
    VLANs identified by a 12-bit number.
