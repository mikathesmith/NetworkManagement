Shell scripting
- vim is in the vi family. 
-to prevent auto-indenting, use <<:a>> in vim, hit return, paste with command V, press enter to ensure cursor at beginning of line, then hit Esc or ^C. 
-sh = bourne shell, command interpreter which runs shell scripts (sh files) 
-bash is an sh-compatible implementation, a superset of sh
- find -print : 

Scripting video:
- mkdir -p create any parent directories needed
- ~/bin, tmp, /local/share/geoscope
- usr share - architecture independent files e.g. icons
- ls -l, -la : all details 
- PATH variable - specifies where to look for files by default. Edit .bashrc
- $HOME expands to home directory, like ~
- . is shorthand for source, internal shell command
- :syntax on - color
- ssh gallardo, logout 
- bash is same on every system
- execute bit needs to be set to run as command: chmod -x ~/bin/hello
- routing table - Patricia Triae
- | pipe into
- which command finds directory of file
- cut -d’ ‘ -f1: excludes first field of file, IP addresses
- sort, uniq
- touch to create a file that doesn’t exist
- can specify file for cut, or by default stdin
- bash $@ - special parameters. Expands to as many positional parameters/arguments that you pass to the shell script. 
- 404 - web server saying the page doesn’t exist
- -w the word 
- grep: generates/filters output 
- add -- to the end of svn remove
- uniq -c 


1. Create a script that is passed Apache server logs as input and creates a summary showing each unique client’s IP address as well as whether it is a local, domestic or international client. Basic application of geolocation = trying to find out which country a particular request is coming from. 
- billing for traffic, domestic vs International
- display unique IP addresses in access log 
- ip-to-country.csv range of 32 bit numbers 
- domestics.txt - NZ’s current set of IP addresses. 
-Geolocation country prefixes
   -Converts IP ranges from CSV to a list of prefixes for a particular country. 
   -pass country code, rip through csv file, convert ranges to set of appropriate prefixes
   -./geolocation_country_prefixes NZ < ip-to-country.csv | head -10 
   -creates domestics.txt
   
-Ip classify - takes text in domestics.txt and locals.txt and will be given a list of IP addresses on stdin. 
   -run as command, outputs same line with international/local
   - takes in addresses on stdin, writes list of address,classification pairs. 
   -
- My script:
   - cut out first field, sort input of IP addresses into a sorted list of unique IP addresses, classify each line according to ip_classify 
   -produce a list of unique IP addresses.
