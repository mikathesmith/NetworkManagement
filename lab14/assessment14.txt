DHCP= Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
-DHCP for automatic IP address assignment, only for IPv4 
-centralised administration
-compatible with BOOTP
-efficiently use a shared pool of addresses 
-dynamically allocated addresses have a lease time period before they are
reassigned, automatically allocated address can be assigned to the same client
as it keeps a table of past IP addresses and their clients MAC addresses. 

How it works
-Client broadcasts UDP request to 255.255.255.255 port 67 -> routers relay
-The first DHCP server may send an offering (one in each subnet/broadcast zone)

-ISC - internet software consortium DHCPd software
-should house DHCP service on diffeent server to DNS service server
-offer a pool fof addresses listed in DNS 


-ddns-update-style: update the data in the effected DNS zones when we issue a
lease by telling the DNS server the new values ie DYNAMIC DNS. 
-option domain-name & option domain-name-servers: DNS-related configuration
details we give to the DHCP client machines. The DHCP server resolves these
names at startup. 
-authoritative: server contains knowledge to tell clients when they are
requesting something that is invalid. - important for portable devices -
responds with a DHCPNAK which tells the client it must reject its current lease
and request a new one 
-subnet 10.0.2.0 netmask : when the server starts, it will look at the
available interfaces. Tell the server not to do anything on our "outside"
subnet; protect ourselves from being a DHCP server on a network in which we are
not meant to be. 
-host client1 : starts a scope where we provide a static mapping between MAC
address and IP address -> can also be provided as a DNS name which is then
looked up before giving it to the client
    fixed address could be IP address or DNS names. Benefit of DNS name is that
    all the mappings between ethernet MAC addresses and DNS names is contained
    in the DHCP configuration and all the mappings between DNS and IP addresses
    are in the DNS. Less error prone! 


What are the risks to a network when using DHCP for configuration of network
details? What can be done about those risks while keeping the benefits of DHCP? 
-Multiple or rogue DHCP servers. Bigger problems when mistakes are made. 
-protect using manual assignment?
