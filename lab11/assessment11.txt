Scheduled Tasks and Log Management
Cron
    running jobs at scheduled times
    fetching mail from ISP, download package updates at night, check system etc
    crontab edits your Cron Tabe. 
    run-parts: a helper program that runs all executable scripts in a directory
    crontab -e to modify or create a crontab
    entries can be thought of as being checked every minute. 

Syslog
    rsyslogd program 
    reliability enhanced logging protocl (RELP)
    Rsyslogd sits in the background, waiting for any program to give it a log
    entry
    Program will speicify a facility and priority
       Eg facilities - auth, cron, daemon, kern, mail
       Priorities range from debug to warning, err, emerg
    /etc/rsyslog.d/l reload rsyslog
    Facility priority = selector
    Logs are kept in /var/log 
         Mesages
         Syslog
         Secure
        Utmp, wtmp, failog

Lab 11 assessment
11.1.1
When will the following crontab entries run? 
1. Every 13th of jan
2. Every 30 minutes at 4:00am every 1st and 15th of month on a friday 
3. Virtualisation host with a lot of guests. How could you improve the situation where cron jobs are starting at the same time, causing the host to be very busy? Massive spikkes.  
    Could change each cron job to run at different times of day, avoiding
    massive spikes

11.3.1
1. Write logrotate entry that rotates the file /var/log/auth.log on a weekly basis. 
    
    /var/log/auth.log {
        missingok #wont throw a fit if the file is not there
        weekly    #rotate weekly 
        rotate 4  #keep backlog of 4 weeks, might be useful security info
    }

2. Describe what happens to the files in /var/log when they are rotated, 
   based on the pattern you find from the outputs
    
   Adds another line each time saying pam_unix(sudo:session): session closed
   for user root,  and increments auth.log. Most recent ones have .gz suffix. Prints out all the files
   matching auth.log* with their name and first 60 characters.  

3. What would be a good thing to do with archived logs? What factors might you need to take into consideration?
	Store in memory for a specified time. Consider memory space and logrotate rate, throughput of
    logs. 

Filtering logs
	Look at various patterns in logs, or filter the mundane entries from the logs. 
/etc/cron.d: logcheck 

1. At what times is logchek run by crond? Explain how logcheck is being run; explain nice and -R
    
    logcheck runs as an hourly cronjob just off the hour and after every
    reboot.

    a 342assignment1.mismith.170410.112930/342assig-R adds reboot to the email subject line
    nice ...? 

2. Why should logcheck be run as the logcheck user and not root or mal? What sysadmin principle does this illustrate?

    It does not require root/sudo permissions therefore you should not use them
    - great power = great responsibility, don't use if not necessary! 

Regex
	Pattern that matches text
    Logcheck uses POSIX extended regular expression syntax
    Grep uses POSI basic syntax

1. Transform the following two log messages into egrep style regex for use with logcheck 

egrep -i '^\w{3} [ :0-9]{11} belgarath sshd\[[0-9]*\]: Accepted publickey for
[a-zA-Z]* from 10\.18\.2\.[0-9]+ port [0-9]*. ssh2'

egrep -i '^\w{3} [ :0-9]{11} belgarath su\[[0-9]*\]: + \?\?\? root:nobody'


Note: to access shared folder VBoxShare in lab9 folder, go install guest
additions in virtualbox settings and sudo -a mount
