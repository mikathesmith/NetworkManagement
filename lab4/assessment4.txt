How support gets added to an IPv6 interface, how we can remove it if required and how we can control some aspects of how IPv6 configures itself. 

Notes:
-Kernel support for IPv6 is contained in a kernel module called ipv6.ko
-Disabling IPv6 in Linux is tricky. 
  -preventing the kernel module from loading
  -unload the module from running system
  -Ubuntu 14.04 LTS does not have a kernel module to unload as support is built in.
   Instead, we can manage addresses on an interface using the ip tool to delete an address
   attached to an interface. 
  -Pass arguments to the IPv6 subsystem to prevent SLAAC generating addresses when IPv6 
   support is loaded into the kernel. Find out what parameters are avalailable using
   modinfo, or add them to the kernel command-line set by the boot loader GRUB. Edit GRUB
   configuration and add “ipv6.disable_ipv6=1” and update-grub to delete all addresses 
   on the given interface and disable IPV6

1. Describe multicast in comparison to unicast and broadcast. Give an example of an IPv6 multicast address

- Unicast is when information is sent from one point to another, from sender to receiver 
  (LAN, Internet). 
- Broadcast is when information is sent from one point to all other points (e.g. ARP)
- Multicast is when information is sent from one or more points to a set of other points. 
    - Multicasting requires that the same packet is delivered simultaneously to a group of 
      clients and uses a special class of destination address which denotes a specific 
      multicast group. 

- ff02::1 - all-hosts link-local multicast address. Every host on the local network (local 
  link: everything up to the first router) will be listening for traffic sent to this 
  address. 


2. Given an example of a link-local IPv6 address. Describe how it is generally formed from the Ethernet MAC address

- A link-local address is an IPv6 unicast address that can be automatically configured
  on any interface. It is valid only for communications within the network segment (link)
  or the broadcast domain that the host is connected to.
- IPv6 requires a link-local address on every network interface on which the IPv6 protocol
  is enabled. 
- Not guaranteed to be unique beyond a single network segment so routers do not forward 
  packets with link-local addresses.
- For IP networks, they are assigned using stateless address auto configuration. 
- For protocols that only have link-local addresses such as Ethernet, we must derive  
  automatically from the MAC

- Prefix  fe80::/64
- Example: fe80::a00:27ff:fe97:164a/64       first 64 bits are used in network address


3. Give an example of a unique-local IPv6 address: 

- Prefix   fd6b for unique local unicast address. 
- Example  fd6b:4104:35ce:0:ac55:2606:750:f1bf/64



4. Describe a solicited node multicast address. What is its purpose? Give an example. How is it formed?
- A solicited node multicast address is an IPv6 multicast address valid within the local-link - e.g. an Ethernet segment. They are used in neighbour discovery protocol for obtaining the link-layer addresses of other nodes. 
- In IPv6, Neighbor Solicitation replaces ARP, and it uses multicast solicited node addresses. 
- Client 1 wants to send an IPv6 packet to Radv’s IPv6 link-local address (local delivery:   
  does not go through a router)
- It does not yet know Radvs link-layer address (layer 2) so it needs to look it up using
  a ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation from Client1’s link-local IPv6 address to the solicited
  node multicast address for the address that shall be pinged. It carries with it 
  Client1’s link-layer Ethernet address. 
- Radv responds with an ICMPv6 Neighbor advertisement from Radv’s link-local IPv6 address
  to Client1’s link-local IPv6 address, carrying with it Fav’s link-layer Ethernet 
  address, which Client1 puts into its neighbour cache. 
- Client1 knows everything it needs to make the local delivery of this IPv6 packet, so 
  sends the ICMPv6 Echo request (ping) from Client1’s link-local IPv6 address to Radv’s 
  link-local IPv6 address. 
- Radv can now send the ICMPv6 echo response packet. 


- Prefix:  ff02::1:FF /104 
- Eg interface with IP address fe80::2aa:ff:fe28:9c5a has solicited node multicast address
  of ff02::1:ff28:9c5a



5. Multicast listener discovery version 2 (MLDv2) snooping is a mandatory feature for any switch that wants to support IPv6. What is the motivation for MLDv2 snooping (IPv4 equivalent is IGMP snooping) with respect to network switches? 

- MLD is used by IPv6 routers for discovering multicast listeners on a directly attached 
  link and to discover which multicast packets are of interest to neighboring nodes.
- Constrains the flooding of IPv6 multicast traffic on VLANs.  
- Edge devices tell their local router to subscribe to a various IPv4/Ipv6 multicast address. 
- The switch can snoop on MLDv2 protocol packets and bridge IPv6 multicast data based on destination multicast MAC addresses. 



6. Describe the most important components of a router advertisement.

- Router advertisements are used so that a host on the network can learn about their local 
  routers to find appropriate source and destination addresses to attach to the 
  advertisement packet. 
- Routers periodically send out RAs, which can be solicited to avoid waiting. 
- ICMPv6 Type will specify the management protocol of different messages it could transmit 
  (type is 134 in a router advertisement)
- ICMPv6 Flags (managed (set=DHCP, not set=SLAAC), other)
- ICMPv6 prefix length (if SLAAC, then advertised prefixes are /64), flags (auto, 
  set=SLAAC). 
-  The most important piece of data is the prefix, i.e. the address being advertised.   



7. Describe Duplicate Address Detection (DAD). Why is it needed and how is it performed? What do you think is the difference between a tentative address and a preferred address, with regard to DAD? 
Asks the network if any other host has the same address, if they do they respond, if not after some time, it expires. 

- After generating an address, send a neighbour solicitation to solicited node multicast 
  address. 
- If anyone answers, its a duplicate and we can’t use it.
