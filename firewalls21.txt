lab 21 firewalls

Policies
 -find out what service name is for each port
 -each service's location and where it should be allowed from
 -understnad how each type of traffic will cross the router 
 -decide whether each direction of the firewall should have an allow-by-default or drop-by-defualt policty

 -as soon as you attach one packet filter to an interface, all interface firewalls change
 their default behaiour from allow to drop
 -implement staeful rule for each firewall to allow packets associated to sessions, and logs
 and drops every other packet it sees. 
 
 -Each interface has three firewalls, in, out, and local. F1 has three interfaces so we
 eventually want up to 9 packets
 
 -FW_LAN_LOCAL-1024D - packet filter name, rule name and fact that it was logged in 
 a drop rule. 
 -IN=eth0 OUT= -infer that it is a local chain because it is going into the router, but
 not out. In IPTables, would appear on INPUT primary chain rathr than the FORWARD or OUTPUT
 chain. - connection attempt came from LAN/eth0
 -SRC=10.18.2.10 DST=10.18.2.1 - source address tells use the packet appears to have come from 
 client1. (could be spoofed) 
 -PROTO=TCP 
 -DPT=22 : knowing the destination port to match traffic
 -SYN- packet to be understood to be initating an SSH connection
